# INSIGHTS-Change-Reason-WebApp
1.1 : Api is conneccted and sende the post request to reach the URL, but doesn't actually post the reason in the Vorne system.

1.2 : have the code working, sends the reason code to Vorne and vorne responds back. There are some code that Vorne is not accepting and sends error message.

1.3 : We figured ou that the validation schema for the reason codes to be readable by the Vorne API is that it should be alphabets and spaces only, 24 places including the spaces. The CSS is updated as per Tempo theme and the fancy CSS buttons are added. This is how it looks right now: <img width="1134" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Tempo-Flexible-Packaging/INSIGHTS-Change-Reason-WebApp/assets/140524949/b5f3fddf-9187-44e9-a012-31531de35e66">
